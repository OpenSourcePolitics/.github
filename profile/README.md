## We build for democracy
[Open Source Politics](https://opensourcepolitics.eu) is a ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· company that works around democratic softwares like [Decidim](https://decidim.org).

with cities and organizations

Based in Paris, we install, maintain and improve Decidim in order to make it efficient for the broadest number of cities and organizations, in France, Europe and worldwide.

## What are we working on ? 
We work around the software [Decidim](https://decidim.org). Based on the framework [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), it uses a [component-based approach](https://cbra.info/) that allows us to develop and maintain different modules, making each Decidim instance easily modular while maintainable.

Our main product is the [decidim-app](https://github.com/OpenSourcePolitics/decidim-app), a canonical Decidim installation bundled with our most used modules.

## We build for democracy
[Open Source Politics](https://opensourcepolitics.eu) is a ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· company that works around democratic softwares like [Decidim](https://decidim.org).

Since 2016, we're working in coordination which cities and organizations to organize participative consultations, moving democracy into a 21th century, where taking opinions of the citizens into account is the norm, as described [in this presentation](https://youtu.be/NXfYNdapq3Q).

Based in Paris, we install, maintain and improve Decidim in order to make it efficient for the broadest number of cities and organizations, in France, Europe and worldwide.

## What are we working on ? 
We work around the software [Decidim](https://decidim.org). Based on the framework [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), it used a [component-based approach](https://cbra.info/) that allows us to develop and maintain different modules, making each Decidim instance easily modular while maintainable.

Our main product is the [decidim-app](https://github.com/OpenSourcePolitics/decidim-app), a canonical Decidim installation bundled with our most used modules.
